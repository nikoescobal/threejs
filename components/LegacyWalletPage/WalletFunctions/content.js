Additionally, the wallet comes with a browser extension which grants you web-access to the exciting world of Web3.',
        'As a long-term believer, you can stake your Legacy Token (LGCT)s for 6, 12, or 24 months to benefit from exclusive rewards. Alternatively, the flexible staking option can be used, so you can withdraw your funds at any time. Our flexible staking option comes with an auto-compounding feature which saves you time by automatically claiming the rewards and by re-staking them. The tokens are held by audited smart contracts to grant high security and performance.',
        'As a private sale, public sale or giveaway participant, you can claim your vested Legacy Token (LGCT)s directly in the wallet. The feature calculates the claimable amount live, so tokens can be claimed in an interval of your choice. Just like the staking contracts, the vesting contracts are audited as well which grants high security and performance.',
        'Bridge your Legacy Token (LGCT)s between the supported blockchains in an instant thanks to our SafeSwap integration. Atomic swaps are used which makes bridging cheap, fast and secure. More than that, we are working on an auto-bridge feature which allows you to send your Legacy Token (LGCT)s from one blockchain to another without needing to bridge them first.'
