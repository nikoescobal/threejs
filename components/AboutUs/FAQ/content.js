        question: 'What does Legacy Network stand for?',
        answer: "<p>Legacy Network is an international technology company from Liechtenstein. We firmly believe that personal development is the key to success in all life areas, as well as the solution for many global problems. Our goal is to create an environment where positive personal development for every single person is easily accessible and possible, for this reason, we committed ourselves to finding new ways to provide something of true value to the world.</p>"
      },
      {
        question: 'What is our vision?',
        answer: "<p>Our vision is to create the world&#39;s biggest personal development ecosystem with our technology as the gate to a successful and fulfilling life. Great technology should work for the user, not against him. In today&#39;s era, big tech companies know much more about us and our psyche than we do. This data is used to sell us more products and leads us to addiction to certain services. We aim to create a technology, which collects the same data but provides it to the user. A technology, developed to give people deep insights into the programming and functionality of their own brain along with individual and playful step by step guidance on how to apply the new gained knowledge.</p>"
      },
      {
        question: 'How do we generate value?',
        answer: "<p>Bringing people together to get the best out of them and fight global mental health problems is our way to add value to our world. Personal development is about gaining a deep understanding of our psyche and human nature in general. The goal is to find harmful traits in ourselves, understand how they prevent us from succeeding in different areas, and replace them step by step with more effective traits.</p>"

      },
      {
        question: 'Why did you choose these blockchains?',
        answer: "<p>The idea behind multiple blockchains is to reach as many people as possible and to take advantage of the individual features of each blockchain. Moreover, we are working with Safehaven, a competent partner which offers secure DeFi solutions such as a multichain bridge for atomic swaps between the blockchains.</p>"

      {
        question: 'Will there be other listings in the future?',

        question: 'Why do we need a NFT?',
        answer: "<p>Our goal is to break common patterns and to make our app as playful as possible. For this purpose, there will be an animated character that mirrors the user and his progress. He will serve as the central character within the app and can grow in his level, just like the user grows in real life. We plan to release a NFT collection where the NFT can be loaded into the app as an avatar. People who own one of our NFTs will get access to various utilities. The NFT collection is divided into different variety levels, this applies to both the design and the benefits that are unlocked.</p><ul><li>Free access to our ecosystem</li><li>Reward distribution</li><li>Higher play to earn rewards</li><li>In-App Features that are only accessible to NFT owners</li><li>In-game character</li><li>Network opportunities</li></ul>"

        question: "Which steps does Legacy Network take to prevent a potential crisis?",
        answer: "<p>Unfortunately, 90% of crypto projects are not able to survive major crashes. The main reason is, that most of these projects are strongly dependent on hype and the crypto market performance. A second reason is, that many projects create short-living entertainment products where an urgent need isn't given. We are more crisis resistant for the following reasons:</p><ul><li>We aren't necessarily a crypto company, we are a technology company that uses crypto/blockchain integration to make its ecosystem more valuable. We have multiple different income streams and expansion opportunities, which means that we are less affected by market fluctuations.</li><li>Our ecosystem is a problem solver which satisfies multiple urgent needs and reacts to global problems which are getting worse year by year. Products that aren't only wanted for a certain time but needed are more enduring. This adds up to the strength of our fundamentals.</li></ul>"

      {
        question: "How can the LGCN token be used?",
        answer: "<p>LGCN is a multichain payment and utility token which can be used within the Legacy Network ecosystem. Its main purpose is to encourage our users to actively use our ecosystem and contribute to its growth.</p><br><p>One of the main problems the world is currently facing is the neurological addiction to short-term reward release in the brain, also called short-term gratification. It's a well-known fact, that one important part of overall success is the preference for education over entertainment. Unfortunately, many people are almost unable to do anything without receiving an instant reward due to the imbalance of their brain chemistry.</p><br><p>For these reasons, we have to release an instant reward consisting of tokens and in-game utilities within our education system to give it an entertaining and satisfying effect.</p><br><p>Utility and payment overview:</p><ul><li>Several in-App purchases like unlocking additional features</li><li>Staking to get access to special rewards and utility</li><li>Purchasing products in our online store</li><li>More in future</li></ul>"
      },
      {
        question: "Is Legacy Network a Ponzi scheme?",
        answer: "<p>To make it short, no. The main attribute of a Ponzi scheme is its dependency on new users to reward existing users. Moreover, the main focus within a Ponzi scheme is to earn money, while the product itself often doesn't generate enough cash flow.</p><ul><li>Our token rewards are distributed out of multiple token pools and the backflow is not dependent on new users. When our ecosystem stops growing, the rewards will stay the same.</li><li>Users don't use our ecosystem with the objective to earn money. The reward distribution is random and its main purpose is to trigger the neurological reward system in the user's brain in order to keep him engaged. Our goal is to reward users instantly for doing positive things which usually wouldn't trigger an instant reward.</li><li>As we have multiple cashflows with one of them using a subscription model, we are only dependent on new users when it comes to growth, not when it comes to survival.</li></ul>"
      },
      {
        question: "When will Legacy Network launch?",
        answer: "<p>The estimated launch for the app is Q2 2023. Nevertheless, in order to ensure an optimal start of the project and to protect the interests of everyone who's involved, we will carefully observe the current market situation to determine a good launch date. Our goal is to launch into an up-trending market which gives us the backwind to gain even more attention and grant more people access to the benefits of our ecosystem.</p>"

      {
        question: "What does the marketing strategy look like?",
        answer: "<p>We believe in diversified marketing which is close to the audience. Close in this case means, that we are going to be fully transparent about everything we are planning and doing. One of our strengths as a team is organic and effective community building. Our goal is to attract family members, not just followers. Everybody should have the opportunity to join the Legacy Network ecosystem, profit from it, and to actively contribute to its growth and quality.</p><br><p>One of our advantages is, that we are operating in a field, which can be marketed very well. Not only do we react to multiple urgent problems the world and its residents are currently facing, we do also provide an effective solution that truly helps.</p><br><p>Marketing overview:</p><ul><li>Focus on creating a great product which sells itself without much explanation</li><li>Paid Reddit ads in subreddits around personal growth (highest interest/need)</li><li>Building a strong and highly engaged community</li><li>Exciting community events regularly</li><li>Providing valuable content to our audience</li><li>Ambassador marketing</li><li>Brand awareness campaigns</li><li>PR presence</li></ul>"

      },
      {
        question: "How trustworthy is the project?",
        answer: "<p>Security is a very important topic, especially in the crypto space. Unfortunately, the whole space is still a bit of a wild west due to its age and a lack of positive regulations.</p><br><p>There are a few key factors that help to determine whether a project could be fraudulent or not:</p><ul><li>The team: The team should be fully doxed/public and the members should have a positive track record.</li><li>The regulatory environment: The company should be based in a safe country with strict financial laws.</li><li>Transparency: The team should communicate well with the community. The more transparent and honest a project is, the better.</li><li>Decentrality: The tokens should be distributed in a way that nobody has enough power to have a serious and lasting price impact by selling.</li><li>Strong fundamentals: The project should be strong enough to survive heavy market conditions. It should provide real value to its users, it shouldn’t be too dependent on the market conditions and it should have room for expansion/scaling.</li></ul>"

        question: "What does the company structure look like?",
        answer: "<p>Legacy Network is an unlisted public limited company based in Liechtenstein (next to Switzerland). The environment Switzerland/Liechtenstein is one of the most secure and well-known financial marketplaces in the world. Our executive board consists of five people (CEO, CFO, COO, CTO, and CO-CTO), in total we have 14 team members who are working full-time.</p><br><p>We are working with a crypto-specialized Swiss private bank which is very selective. Furthermore, the law of Liechtenstein requires a professional board of directors which includes at least one financial law expert to ensure that all regulations are met and that the company doesn't act negligently.</p><br><p>Furthermore, we had to go through multiple profound KCY processes which means that we are fully checked and as safe as we can be.</p>"
