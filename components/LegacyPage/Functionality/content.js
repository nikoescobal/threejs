          Users can select modules that align with their needs and build their knowledge step-by-step. Each module consists of Levels & Lessons, with each lesson focusing on a specific concept. Lessons include text, visual elements, and a practical task that must be completed. At the end of each module, users take a set of questions to ensure they have grasped the key takeaways. This repetition is designed to solidify their understanding and to help them retain the information. Upon passing a lesson, users receive rewards, including XP, and progress to higher levels within the module.

          The whole learning journey is gamified and supported by AI, providing an engaging experience. As users make progress, they level up their in-game character, which acts as a motivator to keep learning. The overall process is designed to make learning enjoyable and effective, encouraging users to continue their personal growth journey.

            In the education area of the Legacy App, the user can choose from various categories.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Each category contains content, which can be text, video, animation, podcast (audio content) and other forms. Each category has its own level system.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Our AI uses targeted questions, user behavior, feedback, app tracking and other parameters to decide how advanced the user already is and which content is relevant to him.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            This makes the system usable for everyone, whether beginner or professional. The content consists of both a theoretical and a practical part. A topic is explained to the user in an understandable and detailed manner, after which the AI suggests concrete strategies and goals for implementation. The goals are added to the user account and the user is regularly reminded of them. If he does not achieve the goals, the AI suggests suitable alternatives. Rewards in the form of tokens and experience points are distributed for passing a level.
