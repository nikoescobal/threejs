        <h3>What is personal development about?</h3>
        <p>
          Personal development is about gaining a deep understanding of our own
          psyche as well as human nature in general. The goal is to find harmful
          traits in ourselves, understand how they prevent us from succeeding,
          and replace them step by step with more effective traits. During this
          developmental journey, we can find ourselves, overcome our fears and
          weaknesses, develop life-changing skills and unlock our full
          potential.

        <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
        <p>
          We humans tend to believe that we don&apos;t have much control over
          our destiny. We think that our potential is as limited as our
          possibilities are. In reality, these beliefs are an illusion. Our
          success/happiness is a direct reflection of our personality and our
          personality is a direct reflection of our individual programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          This programming includes our beliefs, thoughts, habits, behavior
          patterns and our neurological conditioning. It controls everything.
          The way we approach certain challenges, how quickly we recover from
          setbacks, how we react to different situations etc. It also determines
          our level of self-confidence, self-love, resilience, assertiveness,
          discipline, emotional control, and more.
