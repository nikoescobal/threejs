        <p>
          Personal development is about gaining a deep understanding of our own psyche as well as human nature in general. The goal is to find harmful traits in ourselves, understand how they prevent us from succeeding, and replace them step by step with more effective traits. During this developmental journey, we can find ourselves, overcome our fears and weaknesses, develop life-changing skills and unlock our full potential.

        <p>
          We humans tend to believe that we don't have much control over our destiny. We think that our potential is as limited as our possibilities are. In reality, these beliefs are an illusion. Our success/happiness is a direct reflection of our personality and our personality is a direct reflection of our individual programming.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          This programming includes our beliefs, thoughts, habits, behavior patterns and our neurological conditioning. It controls everything. The way we approach certain challenges, how quickly we recover from setbacks, how we react to different situations etc. It also determines our level of self-confidence, self-love, resilience, assertiveness, discipline, emotional control, and more.
